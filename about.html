            Hepler's Doxie Doodle was established six years ago right here in sunny Bradenton, Florida. We're here for those who are looking for a new best friend—and have chosen to make it a Dachshund! We have puppies and young adults who may be looking for their furever homes, and we do our best to pair the two together for a happily ever after. ❤🐾
            You will not find anything to do with Poodles here! Our name is simply "Doodle" 🐾—which is something our dogs just love to do.
